            <br><p>Xin chào, my name is <b>Huy</b> and from <b>Viet Nam</b>, I have a lot of Western names for my interests and anonymity on online activities. You can call me <b>Raymond</b> as I use it most of the time.</p>
            <p>A little bit about <a href="online.html">my online interests</a> are gaming, the first time I know about computer is in cyber café where my cousin teach me how to use it and playing video game.But now I don't play video game anymore, I played it more than 10 years and didn't got better, so it's time to get a break-up. Not because I don't want to play rather I interested in cybersecurity and computer stuff.
            <br> </p> <p> I was interested in cybersecurity because some reason. First up is that it really cool and interesting, it has a wide range of area for anyone to specific personality and ability, example if you are an extrovert, you can do kind of phishing attack it usually use in Red Team and Black Hat, my preference is technical cause I'm a bit quiet person, not like talking much, but if the topic is my interests you'll forgot my character.<br></p> <p>Second is that it really hard and it changing constantly overtime. So we can be creative in our journey</p>
