            <h3> Intro</h3>
            <br><p>Xin chào, my name is <b>Huy</b> and from <b>Viet Nam</b>, I have a lot of Western names for my interests and anonymity on online activities. You can call me <b>Raymond</b> as I use it most of the time.</p>

            <p>A little bit about <a href="online.html">my online interests</a> are gaming, the first time I know about computer is in cyber café where my cousin teach me how to use it and playing video game.But now I don't play video game anymore, I played it more than 10 years and didn't got better, so it's time to get a break-up. Not because I don't want to play rather I interested in cybersecurity and computer stuff.
            <br> </p>

            <h4>Cybersecurity</h4>

            <p> I was interested in cybersecurity because some reason. First up is that it really cool and interesting, it has a wide range of area for anyone to specific personality and ability, example if you are an extrovert, you can do kind of phishing attack it usually use in Red Team and Black Hat, my preference is technical cause I'm a bit quiet person, not like talking much, but if the topic is my interests you'll forgot my character.<br>
            </p>

            <p>Second is that it really hard and it changing constantly overtime. So we can be creative in our journey. Maybe those are the reasons</p>

            <h4>Coding</h4>

            <p>While learning the fundamental, I don't really making any small project, but when I roll in <b>CS50</b>'s projects I realize that I love coding, enjoy the works solve problems. I don't know should I become an developer or pentester, red teamer. Currently I still follow cybersecurity, if anyone has any project that need a hand, I volunteered to be a volunteer.</p>

            <h4>Languages</h4>

            <p>As you know I'm a vietnamese guy. Seriously I studied English about three years ago, not really advocated though. But can read quite well in IT field. I'm still learning Enlish cause I feel not good about daily conversations and other topics, so this is my truly heart words that I really hoping to find some friends to talk more about life and other topics.<br>
                I'm currently also learning Chinese about two months so, if you know or interested we can talk about it. I find out that learning Chinnese really fund and addicted. I still remember the first time my grandfather taught me how to write "中国" which means "China" when was really small, but when my grandfather dead no one taught me until now it was one of my interests.
            </p>

            <h3>Experience</h3>

            <p>When my yearning for become a hacker really strong, I decided to take the action on doing researching and studying. I find and watch a lot of youtube videos on how to become a hacker then I </p>
