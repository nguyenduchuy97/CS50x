                    <p>The first online video game I played was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(2007_video_game)"><b>Cross Fire</b></a>.Crossfire is an online tactical first-person shooter game developed by Smilegate Entertainment for Microsoft Windows. It was first released in South Korea on May 3, 2007. I played some other game like PUBG and some on mobile device. I actually played the first video game was an offline one named Counter Strike 1.1 (Half Life). They help me build my analytical skill and self-learning very much. The fun is that I can break the law and think outside the box, that's was really annoying for other players, I don't like rules or any consents in the game.
