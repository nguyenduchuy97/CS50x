#### Description: Extended Hashing Generator
#### Overview
<p>The Extended Hashing Program is a versatile command-line tool designed to hash both messages and files using a wide variety of cryptographic hashing algorithms. It combines the capabilities of Python's built-in hashlib library and the pycryptodome library to provide extensive support for numerous hashing algorithms. This tool is ideal for anyone like me who like playing CTF challenges that required verious hashing algorithm types, because really don't like have to install a lot of tools for different algorithms so I combine them all together for our convenience and security enthusiasts who need a reliable way to generate hashes for different types of data.
