#### Description: Password Hashing Generator
<p>Password Hashing Generator is a lightweight tool for hashing your password.It containsP: MD5, SHA_1, SHA_224, SHA_256, SHA_384, SHA512, SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, SHA3_512, SHAKE_128, SHAKE_256 hash types and there are SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256.</p>
<p>You just open it with command: python hasher.py </p>
<p>It will open up and require your input hashing agorithm type, after inputed hashing agorithm type, it will then prompt for input the password you want to hash. If you choose one of the SHAKE types you will be prompt for the the length of the hashed output</p>
<p>I have limited the length of the hashed output between 1-255 characters in length, there might no one's gonna set to set the length so long nor too short. So it is up to you.</P>
<p>You can exit with "exit()" command or press "Ctrl + C" to exit out of program if you need to.</P>

That's all with flexible hashing password program, I might improve it while play CTF.
But for now that's enough for someone play CTF in the entrance of CTF.
