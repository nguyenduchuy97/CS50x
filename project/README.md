#### Description: Password Hashing Generator
<p>Password Hashing Generator is a lightweight tool for hashing your password.It containsP: MD5, SHA_1, SHA_224, SHA_256, SHA_384, SHA512, SHA3_224, SHA3_256, SHA3_384, SHA3_512, SHAKE_128, SHAKE_256 hash types and there are SHAKE-128 and SHAKE-256.</p>
<p>You just open it with command: python hasher.py </p>
You just open it up and input hashing agorithm type, then the password you want to hash,
if you use SHAKE-type you must enter the length of hashed output, I limit it between 1-255,
no need to set the length so long nor too short.
You can exit with "exit()" command or press "Ctrl + C" to exit out of program.
That's all with flexible hashing password program, I might improve it while play CTF.
But for now that's enough for someone play CTF in the entrance of CTF.
